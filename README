crackxls2003

This program may be used to break the encryption on Microsoft Excel
XP/2002/2003 files which have been encrypted using the RC4 method. These
files are encrypted using a 40-bit-long key. It will not work on files
encrypted using later versions or versions 8.0 or earlier.

Run the command with

$ ./crackxls2003 [filename.xls]

The program will read what it needs from the file and print its progress
in working through the possible keys. You can stop the program and resume
where you left off by using the "--start" or "-s" option, whose argument
is 5 hexadecimal bytes separated by spaces, and specifies a key to start
searching from. Example:

$ ./crackxls2003 -s "00 00 00 00 00" [filename.xls]

The program will display a working key if it finds one. Note the program
does not decrypt the file - another program must be used for this.

The "--test-speed" or "-t" option calculates the number of keys which are
tested per second.
