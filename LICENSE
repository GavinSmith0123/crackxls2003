OpenSSL linking exception -

In addition to the licences above, as a special exception, I (Gavin Smith)
give permission to link the code of this program with the OpenSSL library
and distribute linked combinations including the two. Other restrictions
may apply, such as those due to the rights of other copyright holders.

You must obey the GNU General Public License (or any other applicable licence
for included code, such as the BSD-style licence of the files from the POLE
project) for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.

This exception does not reduce the rights already granted to you by the
GNU General Public License: in particular, you may extend this exception
to derived works, but you are not obligated to do so.
